<h1>Mushroom Mac ‘n’ Cheese, 42p</h1>

<h2>Serves three people, or two particularly hungry ones, at 42p each</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 onion, 9p (90p/1.5kg, Sainsburys)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil, 3p (£3/3l)</li>
  <li>A pinch of salt, 1p (25p/1kg, Sainsburys Basics)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp flour, 2p (65p/1.5kg)</li>
  <li>400ml milk – or vegan equivalent, 18p (44p/1l)</li>
  <li>150g mushrooms, 36p (97p/400g, Sainsburys Basics)</li>
  <li>Half a ball of mozzarella, 22p (44p, Sainsburys Basics)</li>
  <li>Scant edge of a teaspoon of mustard, 1p (45p/180g, Sainsburys Basics)</li>
  <li>200g pasta, 14p (35p/500g Sainsburys Basics)</li>
  <li>15g hard strong cheese, 18p (£2.30/200g, Sainsburys Basics)</li>
  <li>A slice of bread, 2p (40p/22 slice loaf, Sainsburys Basics)</li>
</ul>

  <li>First peel and finely chop your onion and sling it in a saucepan with a slug of oil.</li>
  <li>Cook on a gentle heat for a few minutes to soften, season with salt, and sprinkle in the flour. Mix briskly so that the flour coats the onions.</li>
  <li>Add a liberal splash of milk and beat well to form an oniony paste. It doesn’t look all that at the moment, but don’t worry, it’s going to get better. Add another splash of milk, and another, keeping it moving so it doesn’t catch and burn, nor go stiff and sticky. Stiff and sticky certainly have their uses, but neither of them are needed in this particular scenario. Repeat until all the milk is used up; it will be quite runny at this point, but it will firm up in the oven later.</li>
</ol>
