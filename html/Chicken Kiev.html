    <h1>Chicken Kiev and Bacon Mash</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>6 Chicken Breasts</li>
     <li>180g Salted Butter</li>
     <li>6 Large Potatoes</li>
     <li>12 Rashers of Smoked Bacon</li>
     <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
     <li>4 Eggs</li>
     <li>Plain Flour</li>
     <li>2 Cloves Garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Add 150g Butter to a bowl, with a large handful of both chopped tarragon and parsley. Grate in 2 cloves of garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Mash together. Wrap your butter in cling film. Mould in to a cylinder shape, and then place in fridge for 30 minutes to firm up.</li>
     <li>Potato time. Chop up your bacon and add to a pan. Cook until crispy.</li>
     <li>Get your potatoes boiling in a pan of water. Once cooked through, drain, and then re add to the pan. Add a tablespoon and a half of butter, a handful of chopped parsley and tarragon, salt, pepper and a small drizzle of olive oil. Mash everything together. Once mashed, add your bacon and fold it through. Set mash aside.</li>
     <li>Chicken time. Take a chicken breast. Cut a slit in the thick side. Work the knife and your index finger in to the slit, and make a hole to hold the butter. Ideally you want to keep the slid quite small so the butter doesnâ€™t flow out.</li>
     <li>Take your butter out the fridge. Cut some small discs. Squeeze them in to the chicken hole. Repeat with the other three breasts.</li>
     <li>Lay out 3 bowls. Fill one with flour, the other with 3 eggs (whisk and season with salt and pepper) and the last with breadcrumbs.</li>
     <li>Dip your chicken in the flour, then the eggs, then the breadcrumbs.</li>
     <li>Heat a large frying pan with a good drizzle of oil. Add your breasts to the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes each side, until the breadcrumbs and golden.</li>
     <li>Remove the breasts from the frying pan and add to a roasting tray. Plan in oven for 12-15 minutes until cooked through.</li>
     <li>Serve the chicken on a large spoonful of the bacony mash. Cut it open and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
