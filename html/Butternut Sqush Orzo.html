<h1>Butternut Squash Orzo</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Garlic</li>
 <li>Vegetable Stock</li>
 <li>Parmesan</li>
 <li>750g Orzo</li>
 <li>Bunch of Basil</li>
 <li>Goat's Cheese</li>
 <li>2 Butternut Squash</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/356°F.</li>
 <li>Cut your butternut squash into cubes, and place in baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place in oven for 30 minutes or until soft.</li>
 <li>Remove squash when soft. Place 3/4 in a blender. Place remaining quarter back in oven until brown and caramelized.</li>
 <li>Into the blender, add a vegetable stock cube and a pint of water. Blitz. You want quite a loose purée consistency.</li>
 <li>Get a large frying pan on the heat. Add 1 clove of chopped garlic with a splash of olive oil. Once softened, pour in the squash purée. Mix it about, and then add your orzo.</li>
 <li>Keep beating the orzo about, and pouring in splashes of water until the orzo has cooked through and resembles a loose, oozy risotto. At this point, add your remaining squash, and a handful of chopped basil. Mix it all together and turn off the heat.</li>
 <li>Add large dollops of goat's cheese onto the orzo, sprinkle over some parmesan, scatter on the leftover basil leaves and serve with a last drizzle of olive oil! Enjoy!</li>
