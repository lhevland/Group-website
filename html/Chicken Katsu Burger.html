 <li>Get a pan on the heat and add a very large glug of vegetable oil. Once oil is hot, add your chicken thighs. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until the breadcrumbs are golden. Keep turning the chicken until it is cooked through.</li>
 <li>Toast your brioche buns</li>
 <li>Assembly time. Add a very large dollop of katsu mayo to your bun. Then add your chicken. Then add a large spoonful of the zingy slaw. Dollop some more katsu mayo on the top half of the bun, and place that on top of the burger. Take a bite and enjoy!</li>
