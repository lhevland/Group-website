<h1> Barley and Broccoli Risotto </h1>
<p3>
  <ul>
<h2> Ingredients:</h2>
<li>100g wholegrain pearl barley</li>
<li>2 tsp reduced-salt vegetable bouillon powder</li>
<li>2 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
<li>1 large leek chopped</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves</li>
<li>2/3 pack basil</li>
<li>generous squeeze of lemon juice</li>
<li>125g Tenderstem broccoli</li>
</ul>
<h2> Method:</h2>
<ol>
</li>Pour a litre of cold water over the barley, cover and leave to soak overnight.
</li>The next day, drain the barley, reserve the liquid and use it to make 500ml vegetable bouillon. Heat half the oil in a non-stick pan, add the leek and cook briefly to soften. Tip half into a bowl, then add the barley and bouillon to the pan, cover and simmer for 20 mins.</li>
</li>Meanwhile, add the garlic, basil, remaining oil, the lemon juice and 3 tbsp water to the leeks in the bowl, and blitz to a paste with a stick blender. </li>
</li>When the barley has cooked for 20 mins, add the broccoli to the pan and cook for 5-10 mins more until both are tender. Stir in the basil pur√©e, heat very briefly (to retain the fragrance), then spoon into bowls to serve.</li>
</ol>
